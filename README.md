Tool to explore the correlations between sediment variables (Mass Accumulation Rate, Dry Bulk Density, Loss on Ignition, Grain-sise statistics) over time across different sites into the marsh (OC-01 at edge to OC-03 15m from edge). Select a site and two variables, then adjust the year window to see an updated plot with a calculated Pearson correlation.
